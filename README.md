## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Back-end Developer Intern. Studying at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology and Education as 4th-year student, I have learned and used NodeJS and ExpressJS for 8 months ... 


## Lessons Learned
### NoSQL

I had first approach to NoSQL database (MongoDB), knew some popular terminologies such as document, subdocument, schema, .... Having basic knowlegde about relationship in document database. For the ORM, I had got that using subdocument and pre-hook would benefit of flexible structure of schema.

### Security

Beside access and refresh tokens, I had first time to implement remember token for maintaining long session.
