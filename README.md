## Lessons Learned
**NoSQL**

I had first approach to NoSQL database (**MongoDB**), knew some popular terminologies such as document, subdocument, schema, .... Having basic knowlegde about relationship in document database. For related **ORM**, I had got that using subdocument and pre-hook would benefit of flexible structure of schema.

**Security**

Beside access and refresh tokens, I had first time to implement "remember token" for maintaining long session. 

Using "Lock Token" for temporary attribute of reset password link.

**Realtime**

I used **Socket.io** library as for features working in realtime.   

**Others**
